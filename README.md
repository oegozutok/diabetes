Diabetes is one of the most prevalent global diseases, impacting more than 450 million people worldwide and in America. Diabetes is a serious condition in which blood sugar regulation is affected in the pancreas by hormones like insulin. Diabetes can be deadly since it is important for organs in the body to maintain a stable intake of nutrients, which largely is mediated by glucose. Without consistent presence of glucose, there have been reports of brain or other types of tissue damage.

As new data gets published and as years progress, processing becomes better, it is important to reassess what is known in the field of medicine about diabetes and test it statistically to ensure that our knowledge across different datasets and methods produce the same results about diabetes which affects millions everyday. Also, this BRFSS survey is weighted differently than the previous ones, hence the importance of our study.

Methods

This dataset contains the 2015 annual survey results carried out by the CDC which is titled Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This program collects data from over 400,000 Americans on health metrics, on whether they have chronic conditions, preventative measures used against them, and if they have diabetes.

This data was collected from adults with a cellular phone and is residing in a private residence or college housing. A point of bias could be a selection bias against people who would not want to take the survey over the phone if offered, also because of its length due to many variables involved. The CDC states that the majority of households use some sort of phone line, whether it be a landline or a cell phone. Nevertheless, this potential source of bias is unlikely to be significant because we are looking at what affects diabetes. Our study might have been affected if we were looking at prevalence of diabetes in different age groups, where younger people would take the phone survey less.

The CDC does not report any other potential biases about this survey.
